### SOME OPERATIONS I DID ON THE ORIGINAL FILES ###

1 - I renamed the table names in the models to lowercase because I couldn't do "\d Artist or Venue or Show" in the postgres shell

I kept getting the following output: Did not find any relation named "Venue" etc.

2 - I added some HTML in the home.html file to implement the recent artist and recent venue list functionality.
I also edited the main.html file to add some JavaScript for the functionality of deleting an artist, venue

3 - I edited the form HTML files to add validation errors when submitting forms with invalid data.

4 - I extracted the date formatting function in the utils folder and the models in the models folder.
