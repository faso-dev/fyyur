### SOME OPERATIONS I DID ON THE ORIGINAL FILES ###

1 - I renamed the table names in the models to lowercase because I couldn't do "\d Artist or Venue or Show" in the postgres shell

I kept getting the following output: Did not find any relation named "Venue" etc.

2 - I added some HTML in the home.html file to implement the recent artist and recent venue list functionality.
I also edited the main.html file to add some JavaScript for the functionality of deleting an artist, venue

3 - I extracted the date formatting function in the utils folder and the models in the models folder.


### STAND OUT ###

1 - Add Album and Song Models

2 - Add Album and Song forms

3 - Add Album CRUD controllers routes and views for Artist

4 - Add Song CREATE controller route and view for Album

5 - Add timedelta format function for track duration

6 - Add search by city and state for Artists and Venues

7 - Show Recent Listed Artists and Recently Listed Venues on the homepage,

8 - Add deletion for Artists and Venues on edit page
